**oops:**
**object-oriented programming:**
* object
* class
* inheritance
* polymorphism
* abstraction
* encapusulation



**global data:**
fun1()
fun2()
fun3()



**object:data**
fun1()
fun2()



**object data:**
fun1()
fun2()



**object:**
1. state
2. behaviour
3. identity



**A class in java can contains:**
* fields
* methods
* constructors
* blocks
* nested class and interface

new keyword:Used to allocated memory at runtime.All objects get memory in Heap memory area.



Ways to initialize object:
By reference variable-Intializing object simply means storing data into object
By method
By 

OBJECT AND CLASS EXAMPLE:MAIN WITHIN CLASS:
class Student
{
  int id;
  String name;
  
  public static void main(String args[])
  {
    Student s1=new Student();
    System.out.println(s1.id);
    System.out.println(s1.name);
  }
}

OBJECT AND CLASS EXAMPLE:MAIN OUTSIDE CLASS
class Student
{
  int id;
  String name;
}
class TestStudent1
{
  public static void main(String args[])
  {
    Student s1=new Student();
    System.out.println(s1.id);
    System.out.println(s1.name);
  }
}

#
class Student
{
  int reg;
  String name;
  void assign(int r,String n){
    reg = r;
    name = n;
  }
  void print(){
    System.out.println(reg+" "+name);
  }
}
public class Main{

  public static void main(String args[])
  {
    Student m1 = new Student();
    m1.assign(101,"arun");
    Student m2 = new Student();
    m2.assign(102,"Karthick");
    m1.print();
    m2.print();
  }
}

constructor:
to initialize the object
constructor is invoked at the time of object creation

types:
default constructor
parameterized constructor


Rules:
Constructor name must be same as its class name
Constructor must have no explicit return type

polymorphism:
polymorphism means many forms
Achieved in 2 ways:
compile time polymorphism -Method Overloading
Runtime polymorphism-Method Overriding

Abstraction:
process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.
Ways to achieve Abstraction:
1.Abstract class
2.interface

Encapsulation:
process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit.
can make the class read-only or write only methods to set & get the data in it.
control over the data
